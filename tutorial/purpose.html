Upon a programmer's first brush with the Cocoa API (based upon NeXT's derivative of Objective-C),
this new language can seem a little befuddling to the uninitiated with different terms and new
methods to design interfaces.

While I will try and dumb down this tutorial enough so I don't lose too many people (myself
included), I'm not going to stop to explain basic programming concepts (i.e. What's a compiler?). 
If you are reading this tutorial, hopefully you have at least some background in programming,
preferably in C, C++, Java, or best yet, Objective-C.

To create your own scientific calculator, you will need these items:
<UL>
  <LI>A Macintosh computer with Mac OS X (preferably 10.1 or newer)</LI>
  <LI>Project Builder</LI>
</UL>
The EdenMath scientific calculator was designed on a 400 MHz Gigabit G4 PowerMac with 896 MB of RAM and a Year 2001 500 MHz G3 Ice iBook with 320 MB of RAM.  The iBook ran Mac OS 10.1 and Project Builder 1.1, and the PowerMac was equipped with Mac OS 10.2 and Project Builder 2.1.  Project Builder and other Apple Developer tools
can be acquired by purchasing a retail version of OS X, or by joining the free <A HREF = "http://connect.apple.com" TARGET = "_blank">ADC membership</A> and downloading the appropriate tools under the Download Software:Mac OS X section.

There are some small differences in interface design between Project Builder 1.0 (available for OS 10.0.x) and Project Builder 1.1.  I will make note of any differences I can find.  If you need more reference to PB 1.0, the book Learning Cocoa (1st Edition) is a good reference.
Since EdenMath was compiled on systems pre-OS 10.3, the Xcode IDE will not be mentioned in this tutorial.
