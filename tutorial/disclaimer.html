As with any program, there are multiple ways to design and implement it.  What is being offered in
this tutorial is just one way of many.  I make no offer that this is necessarily the best or the
slickest way to go about creating a calculator.  It comes down to this: the program works.

Since EdenMath is freeware, and this tutorial was included, EdenMath and its code should be used for educational purposes.  Do not redistribute or steal the code to put into your own application and claim it is yours.  Anyway, it would be pretty silly to 
just steal this code, recompile it, and distribute another Scientific Calculator out there, especially since there are quite a few already available (some for free, others available as shareware).
