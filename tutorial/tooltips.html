A tool tip is a small box which appears near the cursor, displaying a small bit of information.  Tool tips can be useful to help identify what buttons do.  The expressions nPr or nCr are familiar those who know probability, but the button names may not be very 
intuitive to those who are not as familiar with the field of probability.  Allowing a tool tip to describe more obscure buttons is a useful tool for the user.
