Welcome to the EdenMath developer's tutorial.  This tutorial has been divided into several sections:

<UL>
  <LI>Starting Up - set up the basic Cocoa application and begin the initial interface and coding design</LI>
  <LI>The Coding - the longest section which details the procedures to write the code and connect it with the calculator interface</LI>
  <LI>Finishing Off - adding the last final touches to round off the application</LI>
  <LI>Download - download and view the latest source code and executable for EdenMath</LI>
</UL>

Before you jump into the main guts of this tutorial, please quickly review at least the purpose and disclaimer pages.  The references page has been made available to point to several other good web sites, books and links which have proven to be beneficial to myself.
